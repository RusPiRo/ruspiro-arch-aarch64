//! # TCR_EL1 - Translation Control Register EL1
//!
//! Determines which Translation Base Registers defines the base address register for a translation
//! table walk required for stage 1 translation of a memory access from EL0 or EL1 and holds
//! cacheability and shareability information.
//!
//! ## Usage Constraints
//! EL0 | EL1 (NS) | EL1(S) | EL2 | EL3(NS) | EL3(S)
//! ----|----------|--------|-----|---------|-------
//! R/W | R/W      | R/W    | R/W | R/W     | R/W
